# üöÄ Patterns 2024 Training

***Rethinking GRASP, SOLID, and GoF for JavaScript and Node.js***

> Translations: [EN](./Patterns-2024.md), [UA](./Patterns-2024-ua.md), [RU](./Patterns-2024-ru.md)

Practical training for rethinking and applying **GRASP**, **SOLID**, **GoF** patterns in asynchronous programming and JavaScript for application and system developers, backend and frontend, Node.js and browser applications.

***Next onboarding will start 1 October 2024***

Understanding these concepts can't just be extracted from a box (or book) and placed into your maind. It varies greatly for different languages and platforms.
Blindly transferring knowledge and practices from C++ or Java to **JavaScript** and C# results in dead ceremonies.
However, they can be revived through practice, tied to realities, and rethought to avoid becoming monstrous and horrors.

## üí° Ultimate Uniqueness
  
From the author of the first course on asynchronous programming in JavaScript (17 years ago, KPI University), many conference talks and lectures on Node.js. Over the years, a lot of experience, code reviews, and practices have been collected and analized to rework the course almost every year, absorbing the best practices. Timur Shemsedinov is also a contributor to many platforms and libraries in open source, including Node.js, Metarhia, geoip-lite, MDN, HowProgrammingWorks, metasync... Timur is one of the first who began to port parallel programming abstractions from C++, C#, Java, Go and other languages ‚Äã‚Äãto JavaScript.

Here's what I suggest learning and practicing:

* üìÇ Module Systems, Dependency Injection, and Inversion of Control
* üì¶ Decomposition of Abstractions and GRASP Principles
* üß© Gang of Four patterns rethinked for JavaScript realities
* üîÆ Principles of Isolation and SoC (Separation of Concerns)
* üë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Separation of Applied and System Code
* üß© SOLID principles: Single Responsibility, OCP, ISP, DIP, LSP
* üåü Multi-Paradigm Programming and Domain-Specific Languages
* üß© Contract Programming and Modeling with Schemas
* üèõÔ∏è Clean Architecture and Layered Architecture

## üìñ Course Structure

### üì¶ Unit 1: Structure and Modularity

Why do we need rethinking and adapting GoF, SOLID, and GRASP for JavaScript/TypeScript realities. How to do it?

**üóìÔ∏è Week 1: Code Characteristics and Optimization Strategies**

> There is a path that leads to radical improvement of the structure and
characteristics of your code. GoF, SOLID, GRASP principles and
patterns, how to apply them and what do we get. Code characteristics:
readability (understanding), reliability, testability,
maintainability, reusability, flexibility, security. Optimal use of
computing resources: processor, memory, input-output and cognitive
resources of developers.

**üóìÔ∏è Week 2: Native features in language and platforms**

> JavaScript has built-in contracts: Thenable, Iterable, AsyncIterator,
Callback-last, Callable, Cancelable, Observable, but the culture of
developing through contracts and interfaces is not popular enough in
the community. How can we improve development performance with
Knowledge-driven approach. How patterns may help us in this direction:
to delivery quick and effective, to be performant, to make everydays
work interesting, to be motivated and never burnout.

**üóìÔ∏è Week 3: Instantiation: Creational Patterns and Techniques**
> Creational patterns: Constructor, Singleton, Factory, Pool, Builder,
Prototype, Flyweight, other patterns and techniques. Let‚Äôs find
related principles and rethink applied importance of GRASP: Creator;
GRASP: Polymorphism, SOLID: ISP; Aggregation and Composition. How to
Save memory and other resources; how to use optimizations and caching.
How to develop extremely quick and low-latency code for any devices
we need to support and make this code clear for colleagues.

**üóìÔ∏è Week 4: Isolation and Separation of Concerns**

> SoC is a general engineering principle to build flexible, reliable,
and easy-modifying systems. We may use GoF patterns: Mediator, Bridge,
Abstract factory, Strategy (JavaScript-specific implementation:
Map<PropertyKey, Implementation>); Modularity; GRASP: Information
Expert, Indirection, and Protected variations principles; SOLID: SRP;
This will improve code testability and reduce integration expenses.

### üì¶ Unit 2: Execution and Contracts

Working with application modules/components integration we need
contract programming; it allows us to develop parts independently;
scale the team; improve project manageability and make a development
plan much predictable.

**üóìÔ∏è Week 5: Contracts: Interfaces for Component Interaction**

> Patterns: Adapter (Wrapper), Facade, Bridge, Composite, Proxy,
Promisify; Front controller; GRASP: Low Coupling and High Cohesion;
SOLID: LSP (Liskov); and SOLID: OCP (Open-Closed); It opens
the possibility of step-by-step refactoring, overcoming technical debt
and increasing subsystem stability; reducing influence (coupling)
between layers and modules. At the top level this makes possible to
scale the team, manage priorities, and make architectural decisions.

**üóìÔ∏è Week 6: Decoupling with Events and Messaging**

> Next great approach is event-based programming. This is useful in UIs,
distributed systems, shared resources cooperative access. Async and
event-driven programming made Node.js the ultimate solution for
non-blocking I/O. We will consider GRASP: Pure Fabrication and Low
Coupling; AsyncQueue and queueing systems, Async collections, etc.

**üóìÔ∏è Week 7: Streams: Data Flows and Transformations**

> Reactive programming has become a separate paradigm; Streams and
Signals are based on GRASP: Pure Fabrication and Event-driven approach
with data transformation operators it is widely used in network
protocols, file system and data access, game dev and financial and
analytical systems, embedded devices control and telemetry; other
subject areas. It gives expressive syntax, higher level of
abstraction, flexibility and performance for better user experience.

**üóìÔ∏è Week 8: Handling Errors: Exceptions and Soft Failures**

> We will explore error-handling best practices using both
exceptions and domain-specific (soft errors). Gracefully recover and
soft failures will increase whole system performance. We will use
Chain of Responsibility, SOLID, Promises, fallback mechanisms to
handle non-critical errors; GRASP: Protected Variations and Custom
JavaScript-specific AggregateError and Error.prototype.cause and
error serialization for network transmission.

### üì¶ Unit 3: Runtime for Applications

Bringing everything together under real-world conditions. In this unit,
we'll explore how the foundational concepts of structure, contracts, and
patterns translate into running, scalable applications. This part will
focus on how runtime considerations shape architectural decisions.

**üóìÔ∏è Week 9: Semantics: Expressive DSLs**

> To improve code expressiveness and clearer semantics; any complex
software needs to invent DSL (domain-specific language). For DSL we
can use well-known syntax, JSON, JSON5, Markdown, and even JavaScript
itself. We will consider patterns: Command, Interpreter, State,
Strategy, Visitor. DSLs makes code readable for domain experts,
analytics and even experienced users. It enhances communication and
understanding, speeds up development, adapt easily to new
requirements, simplify onboarding and knowledge transfer, hides
technical complexity, allows specialists to focus on certain field,
improving project predictability.

**üóìÔ∏è Week 10: All-agnostic as a Default Strategy**

> Developing frameworks-agnostic, platform-agnostic, protocol-agnostic,
database-agnostic, cloud-agnostic systems as a default approach to
ensure flexibility and free architectural solutions; removes vendor
lock, etc. We certainly don't need to implement all aspects of
agnostic approach, but some of them will bring valuable benefits in
system scaling and during system operation. We will use isolation,
GRASP: Controller; SOLID: DIP; using IoC and DI; using interfaces and
Strategy pattern to decouple from implementations.

**üóìÔ∏è Week 11: Scaling Applications and Architectural Styles**

> This week we'll explore how to design systems that can scale and
evolve efficiently by leveraging different architectural styles: such
as DDD, Layered Architecture, SOA, Microservices, Event-Driven,
Monolithic, Ports and Adapters, Clean Architecture, Event-Sourcing,
CQRS, Pipeline, Peer-to-Peer, Client-Server Architecture and how
SOLID, GRASP and GoF can help us in implementing architecture.

**üóìÔ∏è Week 12: Methodology: How to Start Applying Concepts**

> The final part of the program focuses on practical application.
We will go over how to start implementing the concepts and patterns
covered in the course in real-world projects. This session provides
actionable strategies to build a roadmap for adoption. How to identify
the need for patterns and principles. Refactoring legacy Systems,
Introduction of new development techniques and activities; How to
building a Roadmap: Planning your own learning and team development
using the course principles.
