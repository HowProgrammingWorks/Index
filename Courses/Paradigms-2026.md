A practical course exploring how programming paradigms influence code quality, performance, maintainability, and scalability.
Participants will learn when and why to apply procedural, functional, OOP, and metaprogramming techniques to achieve reliability, flexibility, and clarity in real-world systems.
Through hands-on examples, we refine code style to match product goals, improve architecture decisions, and form a strong foundation for building robust software.
