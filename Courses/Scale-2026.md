# Scale 2026

> Scaling complex Distributed, Interactive, Collaborative and Highload applications for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js

A practical and intensive course focused on architecting and scaling modern distributed systems.

We explore techniques for building
- Reliable highload and High performance Platforms
- Real-time collaboration apps, low-latency services
- Distributed systems

Participants will learn scalable architecture patterns, data-consistency models, performance optimisation, autoscaling strategies, and chaos-resilience approaches.
Ideal for engineers designing systems that must handle millions of users, global traffic, and continuous growth.
