# Practice and projects

## Possible options of work organization:

- Contribution to any open-source project or library.
- Contribution to [Metarhia](https://github.com/metarhia).
- A student group project or an open source community project.
- Personal open-source project.

## What is allowed and what is prohibited:

- Any language.
- Any technology stack.
- Any dependencies allowed.
- The repository must be posted on https://github.com in the public domain.
-  A project cannot be immediately uploaded to Github the day before delivery; it needs to be maintained on Github for several months so that the work, commit history and PR (pull request) are visible. It will be good if it is possible to track the improvement of the code base, refactoring and optimization.

## If you make your own repository, it must include:

- Unit tests (optionally system, integration and load tests)
- CI (for example: TravisCI, Github Actions)
- License and list of contributors
- Good repository management: issues, pull requests, (preferably milestones)
- Semantic versioning: https://semver.org/
  - Keep up CHANGELOG.md
  - And release versions in the form of tags
- Customized linter (for js also prettier)
- Dotfiles for version control system and package manager
